  <p>THai food catering service in Delhi. A brand owned by Phra Ram Catering Services Pvt. Ltd. Our service was created to fill the need for snacks and food when you have a party at home, with minimal hassle on your part. We work at a 1 day notice for a minimum of 10 people and do not have a fixed format menu. We charge by the dish, not per head.
    <br/>

Most of the stuff required for a party is already available at home â€“ crockery, service, bar items, beverages etc. We fill the gap for food. We are specialized in Thai food but we do have a small number of dishes from other cuisines.
<br/>

We cater to parties from 10 people onwards. You can choose one cuisine or you can as well mix two or three kinds- the choice is YOURS!!! We are located in New Delhi and Bengaluru and we will deliver anywhere in the cities. Please call us to book your party:
